## Project Review and Opportunity Areas

### Current State
Ollama TUI is a terminal-based user interface for interacting with Ollama models. It's built with Go and uses the Charm libraries (Bubble Tea, Bubbles, and Lip Gloss) to create an interactive terminal experience. The application allows users to:

1. Browse and select from available Ollama models
2. Chat with selected models in an interactive interface
3. See real-time streaming responses
4. Navigate using keyboard shortcuts

### Strengths
- Clean, focused codebase with a single main.go file
- Good use of the Charm libraries for terminal UI
- Real-time streaming of model responses
- Text wrapping for better readability
- Simple and intuitive interface

### Opportunity Areas

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Split the monolithic main.go file into multiple files for better maintainability
   - Create separate packages for models, UI components, and API interactions

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages when Ollama is not running
   - Add better error handling for network issues
   - Provide more user-friendly error messages in the UI

3. **Features**:
   - Add conversation history persistence
   - Implement model parameter customization (temperature, top_p, etc.)
   - Add support for system prompts
   - Implement chat history export/import
   - Add support for model management (pull, delete)
   - Implement syntax highlighting for code in responses

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add a help screen with keyboard shortcuts
   - Implement themes or color customization
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Improve the display of model information
   - Add a status bar with more information

5. **Documentation**:
   - Add code comments for better maintainability
   - Create developer documentation
   - Add examples and use cases to the README

6. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for API interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for the UI

7. **Configuration**:
   - Add support for configuration files
   - Allow customization of the Ollama API endpoint
   - Implement user preferences

8. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the UI is accessible for users with screen readers
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for all actions

9. **Internationalization**:
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Fix hardcoded strings (e.g., "Respuestas aparecerán aquí")

10. **Performance**:
    - Optimize memory usage for long conversations
    - Improve rendering performance for large responses

These opportunity areas provide a roadmap for future development of the Ollama TUI project. Implementing these improvements would enhance the user experience, make the codebase more maintainable, and add valuable features for users.
